        ❖ JavaScript String Methods
        String methods help you to work with strings.
        Method Description
        length The length property returns the length of a
        string.
        indexOf()
        The indexOf() method returns the index of
        (the position of) the first occurrence of a
        specified text in a string.
        lastIndexOf()
        The lastIndexOf() method returns the index
        of the last occurrence of a specified text in
        a string.
        str.slice(x, y);
        • slice() extracts a part of a string and
        returns the extracted part in a new string.
        • The method takes 2 parameters: the
        starting index (position), and the ending
        index (position).
        • If you omit the second parameter, the
        method will slice out the rest of the string.
        str.substr(x, y);
        substr() is similar to slice(). The difference
        is that the second parameter specifies
        the length of the extracted part.
        str.replace(x , y)
        The replace() method replaces a specified
        value with another value in a string.
        Note:
        ✓ Both the indexOf(), and the lastIndexOf() methods return -1 if the text is not found.

        ❖ JavaScript Number Methods
        Number methods help you work with numbers.
        • Number Properties
        Property Description
        MAX_VALUE Returns the largest number possible in
        JavaScript
        MIN_VALUE Returns the smallest number possible in
        JavaScript
        NEGATIVE_INFINITY Represents negative infinity (returned
        on overflow)
        NaN Represents a "Not-a-Number" value
        POSITIVE_INFINITY Represents infinity (returned on
        overflow)
        ✓ Number properties belongs to the JavaScript's number object wrapper
        called Number.
        ✓ These properties can only be accessed as Number.MAX_VALUE.

        ❖ JavaScript Math Object
        The JavaScript Math object allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
        • Math Object Methods
        Method Description
        abs(x) Returns the absolute value of x
        ceil(x) Returns the value of x rounded
        up to its nearest integer
        floor(x) Returns the value of x rounded
        down to its nearest integer
        pow(x, y) Returns the value of x to the
        power of y
        random() Returns a random number
        between 0 and 1
        round(x) Returns the value of x rounded to
        its nearest integer
        ❖ JavaScript If...Else Statements
        Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different
        conditions.
        • Conditional Statements
        In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
        • Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
        • Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
        • Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
        • Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.
        
        Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a
        condition is true.
        Ex:
        if (hour < 18) {
         greeting = "Good day";
        }
        2- The else Statement
        Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is
        false.
        Ex:
        if (hour < 18) {
         greeting = "Good day";
        } else {
         greeting = "Good evening";
        }
        3- The else if Statement
        Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
        Ex:
        if (time < 10) {
         greeting = "Good morning";
        } else if (time < 20) {
         greeting = "Good day";
        } else {
         greeting = "Good evening";
        }
        4- The JavaScript Switch Statement
        Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.
         Ex:
        switch (new Date().getDay()) {
         case 0:
         day = "Sunday";
        Instructor: Sudad H. Abed / Email: shabed@uoanbar.edu.iq
        Lecture Reference: www.w3schools.com
         break;
         case 1:
         day = "Monday";
         break;
         case 2:
         day = "Tuesday";
         break;
         case 3:
         day = "Wednesday";
         break;
         case 4:
         day = "Thursday";
         break;
         case 5:
         day = "Friday";
         break;
         case 6:
         day = "Saturday";
        }
        ❖ JavaScript For Loop
        Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
        JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
        • for - loops through a block of code a number of times
        • for/in - loops through the properties of an object
        • while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
        • do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
        1- The For Loop
        The for loop is often the tool you will use when you want to create a loop.
        Ex:
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
         text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
        }
       
        2- The For/In Loop
        The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object:
        Ex:
        var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};
        var text = "";
        var x;
        for (x in person) {
         text += person[x];
        }
        3- The While Loop
        The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
        Ex:
        while (i < 10) {
         text += "The number is " + i;
         i++;
        }
        4- The Do/While Loop
        The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block
        once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the
        condition is true.
        Ex:
        do {
         text += "The number is " + i;
         i++;
        }
        while (i < 10);
